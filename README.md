# Epitope Prediction Using Hidden Markov Models (HMM)

## Overview
This project aims to develop a computational tool for predicting linear epitopes in antigenic sequences using Hidden Markov Models (HMM). By leveraging immunoinformatics and machine learning, the model identifies regions on antigens that trigger immune responses, accelerating vaccine and therapeutic development. The approach addresses limitations of traditional experimental methods by improving scalability, accuracy, and efficiency.

## Key Features
- **HMM-Based Prediction**: Utilizes probabilistic modeling to capture sequence patterns and dependencies in biological data.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Optimizes state transitions in HMMs to reduce computational overhead.
- **Feature Extraction**: Integrates bioinformatics tools to analyze sequence properties critical for epitope formation.
- **Model Evaluation**: Validates predictions using metrics like accuracy and cross-validation, benchmarked against experimental data.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Curated datasets of antigen sequences with known epitopes (positive/negative examples).
2. **Preprocessing**: Standardized sequence formats, handled missing data, and removed redundancies.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Extracted physicochemical and structural features influencing epitope binding.
4. **Model Development**: Trained HMMs to recognize epitope patterns, optimized using dynamic programming.
5. **Prediction & Refinement**: Applied the model to new sequences and iteratively improved it with feedback.
